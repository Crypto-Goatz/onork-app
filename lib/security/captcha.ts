/**
 * hCaptcha verification for public forms.
 *
 * Mike, 2026-09-15, after a bot signup wave: "This is for forms moving forward
 * to stop spam." Between 2026-08-31 and 09-02, twenty scripted accounts were
 * created on /api/auth/signup. None confirmed, none ever signed in, and each
 * one wrote a contact into the CRM and sent a confirmation email to an address
 * nobody owns. The in-process per-IP counter on that route cannot see a
 * distributed script, which is why the route's own comment already said a
 * captcha was the real wall.
 *
 * SITE KEY is public and belongs in client code. SECRET is not: it lives only
 * in HCAPTCHA_SECRET on the server and is never returned to a browser.
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN WHEN UNCONFIGURED, FAIL-CLOSED WHEN CONFIGURED. If HCAPTCHA_SECRET
 * is absent the check is skipped and says so, so shipping this file cannot take
 * signup down on any deployment that has not been given the key yet. Once the
 * key is set, a missing or rejected token is a refusal. Turning it on is an env
 * var, not a deploy.
